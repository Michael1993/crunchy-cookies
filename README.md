# The Crunchy Cookie Company
### Java Stream workshop for beginners

This repository was made with Java 13 and goes beyond the Java 8
implementation of the Stream API.

## Background

The Crunchy Cookie Company is in trouble and it needs your help to figure out how 
to solve its problems. It needs to handle data in several different ways.

Java Streams to the rescue!

But don't worry, this will be easy as pie. We will start from the simple stuff (like flour,
eggs and sugar) and work our way up to Super Secret Ingredients (like ginger, love
and "a sense of impending doom").

## Who this repository is for

This repository is for people who have a basic understanding of the Stream API
but would like to reinforce that knowledge with exercises.

If you are unfamiliar with the Stream API, here is [a good video to get you started](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/632600397).

This repository does not offer an explanation on how the Stream API works, at all.
This is strictly for familiarizing yourself with the API.

## How to use this repository

To begin, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open it in your
IDE of choice. The classes in the `com.javax1.cookies.basics` and `com.javax1.cookies.advanced`
packages contain unsolved problems (methods) described in their documentation.
Implement the methods (using the Stream API only) and run the unit tests to check
your work. The unit tests follow a naming convention that makes it easier to identify
whether your implementation was successful.

We recommend trying to solve the problems without looking at the code in the 
`com.javax1.cookies.secrets` package.

## If you need help

If you feel stuck, check the documentation on the "Hints" interface the class your
problem is in is implementing. Most IDEs let you do that with hovering your mouse
over the method.

If you just want the solutions, there is a "solutions" branch with my solutions. 
This was made by a single person, so it might not fit your needs and needs to be 
evaluated before applying to real world problems.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute by adding new problems, improving documentation,
simplifying solutions or, really, anything else you are welcome to open issues/pull requests.

## Additional notes

- Eldritch means unearthly, supernatural or eerie. Popularized by the works of H. P. Lovecraft.

- The recipes are test data - not actual recipes. Don't try making them. :D
